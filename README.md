## Installation
    
Once the application has been downloaded, run 'npm i' in your terminal to install dependencies. Once dependencies have been installed, run the 'node index.js' command to begin.
    
## Usage
    
Begin by running the schema file in your mysql terminal to create the database and tables. With everything setup you can then run the index file using 'node index.js'. Once running you are prompted to select an option using the arrow keys to navigate the menu and enter to make a selection. The database should be empty by default so you will need to start off by selecting 'add department' to add your first department for your business. After that is created, you can create a role associated with that department in 'Add a role' and finally you can add an employee and assocaite them with a role and a manager if you made an entry for one already. If needed, you can also update an employee's role using 'update employee'. From there you can now create an extensive database of departments, roles, and employees.
